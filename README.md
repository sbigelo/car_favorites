# Car Favorites

This application allows you to create, read, star, up/down vote, and delete their favorite cars that are separated into three  categories.
 
The purpose of this application is to show my ability to utilize Javascript to manipulate the DOM with some basic functionality.


Instructions:

* git clone the SSH

* bundle install

* rails db:migrate

* rails db:seed
